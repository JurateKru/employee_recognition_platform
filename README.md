# Goals Management System

Welcome to the Goals Management System, a comprehensive web application designed to enhance productivity and streamline goal-setting processes for both employees and managers. This README provides an overview of the system's key features and functionalities.

# User Account Creation and Login

Users can easily create an account by providing a unique username and password. Our secure login process ensures the confidentiality of user information. In the event of a forgotten password, users can conveniently reset it through our user-friendly interface.

Furthermore, the system allows employees and managers to access and review their profiles, which include up-to-date contact information. This feature facilitates seamless communication within the organization, ensuring accurate and relevant details are readily available.

Managers have an additional privilege of viewing profiles of their department's employees, enabling them to stay informed about their team members and foster stronger connections. Moreover, managers can update their own profile picture, adding a personal touch to their professional presence.

# Goal Creation and Tracking
Our system allows users to create goals, specifying their priority, status, and deadline. Both employees and managers can easily update their goals, tracking progress by changing the goal's status. Additionally, users can add explanations or a list of completed tasks related to a specific goal to the journal. This feature promotes effective tracking and monitoring, enabling proactive responses to challenges and providing assistance when needed.

# Performance Reviews
Managers have a powerful tool for creating performance reviews, evaluating employee achievements based on three criteria: Goals Achievement, Teamwork, Innovation, and Work Ethics. Once a review is prepared, employees have the opportunity to review the feedback provided. We highly recommend discussing the results together with the employee to ensure clarity and alignment.

# Additional Features
To enhance user convenience, we have included an overview of popular goal-setting methodologies and tips in the SMART Method section. This valuable resource assists users in setting effective and measurable goals.



We have strived to create a professional and user-friendly experience within our Goals Management System, ensuring that it not only meets but exceeds your expectations. Thank you for choosing our system to help optimize goal management within your organization.
